Front end uses HTTP requests to interact with the server/database.
Uses JSON to communicate.

Goals: make the frontend create http reqs
     & make the backend respond to http reqs

I used flask because I had used it before. I used react-router to manage the different pages, before I started the backend. Flask was just there to handle http requests for the database.
